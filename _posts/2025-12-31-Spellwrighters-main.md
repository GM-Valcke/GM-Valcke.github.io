# Spellwrighters

## Intro

On the last day of 2025 I've completed writing the game Spellwrighters.
It's subtitle:
“A fantasy of unlimited power, where imagination is the only limit to magic.”
has really proven to be correct during playtests. It has challenged us to stretch our creative muscles. 
And I look forward to sharing it with a wider public soon.
All that's left to do is to add artwork and find a place to publish it.
In the meantime this page will be a home for all its accoutrements.
You'll find printable character sheets, the game flow sheet, and a link to the actual game here. 
Below that you'll find a form to send in your own Spellwrighters scenarios, challenges, apotheoses and questions. 
Those will be shared here as well. 

If anyone stumbles across this and has a good way to promote a game about magic, power fantasies and fancy words... Do get in touch. 
We'd love to brainstorm ideas to get this project in front of many more people's eyes.

## Buy Spellwrighters

(A link to buy the game will appear here when the game is launched. I look forward to that day.)

## Character sheet

The default Spellwrighters character sheet designed by [@caveblackwork](https://www.instagram.com/caveblackwork)

## What others have created

Sadly I have no marvelous creations of others to share with you yet. 
But that might change once Spellwrighters is actually published and available for people to read and play.
