Spellwrighter's first full version has been completed and playtested this week. 

It's subtitle:
“A fantasy of unlimited power, where imagination is the only limit to magic.”
has really proven to be correct during playtests.
It challenges us to stretch our creative muscles. 

Earlier playtests already showed that but now we had the chance to let someone play it following the rules as written instead of our guidance. 
This pointed towards a few places where the text was inconsistent or unclear. 
We gathered lots of very useful feedback for the next iteration. 

Work needs to be done but if anyone stumbles across this and has a good way to promote a game about magic, power fantasies and fancy words... Do get in touch. 
We'd love to brainstorm ideas to get this project in front of many more people's eyes.
