Since I couldn't find an easily adapted character sheet for FATE core RPG I decided to make my own. 
It's programmed in LaTeX but creates an editable pdf so no programming knowledge at all is needed to use these sheets.

Since there is a large discrepancy between the lengths of different stunts, aspects, extras, etc... I decided to include a large section called 'notes' for the actual explanations.
This way the actual core of the character sheet will always fit on a single piece of paper. 

Want to make your own version based of these? 
You can!  
Please mention it was based on my sheet and share your creation with me so I can share it with others here as well. 

I made these sheets when I intended to run the module ['Secrets of cats'](https://evilhat.com/product/secrets-of-cats/). That is what the current base file is made for. A more generic file for FATE Core with the skills from the FATE CORE rulebook will be added later.

The basic .tex file

Form-fillable basic pdf (suitable for the secrets of cats module)

Example characters:

These were the four cats I used as pregens for secrets of cats:
Note that I created them while testing and improving the design of the character sheets. There are some slight differences between all these sheets.
