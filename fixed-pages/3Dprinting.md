# 3D printing service â€“ my hobby, your project  

I use my passion for 3D printing to help turn your ideas into reality. Not a large-scale print farm, but a personal service where we work together to bring your project to life.  

## What I can do for you
- **Printing STL files** that you provide.  
- **Designing and modeling** new objects upon request.  
- **Thinking along with you** about creative and practical solutions.  

## Who is it for?
Anyone with an idea but without a 3D printer at hand. 
I'm located near Leuven,BE but shipping options can be discussed.

## How does it work?
- We discuss your idea and the possibilities.  
- If feasible, you will receive a quote in advance.  
- Before printing starts, I ask for a **50% deposit**.  
- The remaining amount is paid upon pickup or right before shipping.  

## Possible applications
- **Gifts** and personalized items.  
- **Advertising and branding**, such as displays or logo items.  
- **Replacement parts**, such as missing pieces from board games, minis, or terrain for roleplaying games.  
- **Utility items** such as holders, clips, or organizers.  
- **Practical gadgets**, including integration of QR codes or NFC tags.
