# My GitHub Pages site

This is a minimal Jekyll site for hosting blog posts and files (PDFs, zips, etc.).

## Quick start
1. Edit `_config.yml` (set `url` and `baseurl` correctly).
2. Put PDFs into the `files/` folder.
3. Create new posts in `_posts/` as `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.
4. Commit & push to GitHub.

## Notes
- For a user site set the repo name to `USERNAME.github.io` and leave `baseurl` empty.
- For a project site set `baseurl: "/REPO"` and update the `url` field.
- Avoid committing very large binaries to the repo; consider Git LFS or external hosting for huge files.
